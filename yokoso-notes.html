  <p>
    I'm excited and inspired by all of your projects, and I want to try to respond to them through demos.
    I thought lyrics would be a nice example for this week, to introduce CSS.

    Some of my earliest memories on the internet were looking up lyrics, especially annotations and translations.
    Many people are first exposed to another languages through songs and lyrics, rather than formal learning.
    Translation is imperfect because there's often too much nuance for a simple 1:1 translation. Things are lost and things are gained. Hence, you'll often find footnoes offering more context to the translation. Translation is ripe for design, because, like the Rosetta Stone's simple three sections, HTML gives us complex tools to invent and express relationships within text and language.

    This is a track I was listening to this week. It's called "ようこそ" which translates to "welcome",
    but the track has been released in English with the title "It's Not So Bad".
    It's written and sung by <a href="https://shibatasatoko.com/?lang=en">Satoko Shibata (柴田聡子)</a>, a Japanese singer-songwriter and poet.
    She's known for the ways in which she plays with everyday language and subjects.

    I don't know for certain what this song was about, but I imagine it is sung from the perspective of a family member or friend who lives in the countryside, who is happy to receive a visitor from the city, far away. It's quite charming because the person excuses the lack of infrastructure and the bugs, and admits to lying about being lonely. I'm strongly reminded of aging family members who live in the countryside, and have even found a person to live with.

    I'm a native Japanese speaker, but I'm not fluent, and I don't have any memories of the time I lived in Japan, so there are countless things that I just don't get. But I believe that even an amateur translation, if approached humbly, is worth it, because it can be enriching for the original, and the process can deepen our understanding of both languages. I translated with a combination of my own basic understanding of Japanese, a little bit of guessing to the context and subjectivity, and checking with people, dictionaries, and search engines.
